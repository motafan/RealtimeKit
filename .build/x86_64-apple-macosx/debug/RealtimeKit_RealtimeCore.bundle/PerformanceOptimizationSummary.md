# Performance Optimization Implementation Summary

## Task 14.1: Memory Management Optimization ✅

### Implemented Components:

1. **Generic Object Pool (`ObjectPool.swift`)**
   - Thread-safe object pooling for frequently created objects
   - Configurable pool size and reset functionality
   - Statistics tracking for pool utilization
   - Reduces memory allocation overhead

2. **Memory Manager (`MemoryManager.swift`)**
   - Weak reference tracking with automatic cleanup
   - Memory pressure monitoring and response
   - Resource cleanup task registration
   - Memory usage statistics and reporting

3. **Object Pool Manager (`ObjectPool.swift`)**
   - Centralized management of multiple object pools
   - Type-safe pool registration and retrieval
   - Global statistics collection

### Key Features:
- Automatic cleanup of deallocated weak references
- Memory pressure detection and aggressive cleanup
- Thread-safe operations with concurrent queues
- Configurable pool sizes and cleanup intervals

## Task 14.2: Network and Thread Performance Optimization ✅

### Implemented Components:

1. **Connection Pool (`ConnectionPool.swift`)**
   - Efficient network connection reuse
   - Automatic connection lifecycle management
   - Idle connection cleanup with configurable timeout
   - Connection statistics and monitoring

2. **Data Compression (`DataCompression.swift`)**
   - Automatic compression for large payloads (>1KB)
   - LZFSE compression algorithm
   - Intelligent compression decision based on size reduction
   - Extensions for RealtimeMessage and UserVolumeInfo compression

3. **Thread Safety Manager (`ThreadSafetyManager.swift`)**
